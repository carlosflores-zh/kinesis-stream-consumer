# Receive from kinesis stream and insert to relational DB
## Trying to sync QLDB and Postgres

- just run:
    - `go run main.go`

- requires to be connected to the stream generated by: https://github.com/carlosflores-zh/qldb-localstack-test/tree/creating-tx-and-inserting
- right now it is using sqlite3 as the relational DB
- not using localstack running on AWS
- need more logic to insert/update/delete but it is working
- need to check some unmarshal errors
